# FutbolGuru: Mvvm/Retrofit2/Dagger2/Room/Glide/Live Data/RxJava2

An app to test myself and my Android-Kotlin skills with the latest techs! :D



## TODO List
Still in development so here is the pending list:
-Unit Tests 
-'Competition Details' functionality
-Migrate RxJava2 to Coroutines (need to learn more about Coroutines!)
-Work on configuration values
-Change style
-Need a deeper understanding of Glide to work with images


## How to use?
Just clone/download/whatever and insert your own API KEY on the Constants.kt file
