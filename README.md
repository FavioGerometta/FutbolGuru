# FutbolGuru: Mvvm/Retrofit2/Dagger2/Room/Glide/Live Data/RxJava2

An app to test myself and my Android-Kotlin skills with the latest techs! :D



## TODO List

Still in development so here is the pending list:

Unit Tests
'Competition Details' functionality 
Migrate RxJava2 to Coroutines (need to learn more about Coroutines!) :muscle:
Work on configuration values :godmode:
Change style :sweat_smile:
Need a deeper understanding of Glide to work with images :dizzy_face:

## TODO List II
Learn markup for readme files :smile:

## How to use?
Just clone/download/whatever and insert your own API KEY on the Constants.kt file
